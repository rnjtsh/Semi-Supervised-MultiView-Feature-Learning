<h3>HELP</h3>
<p>If you have a problem related to a lecture, a homework set, or a project, <b>the 
best way to get help</b> is to add an annotation at the appropriate point in the 
course materials. This will allow you to get help not only from the course staff, but 
also from your class mates. Otherwise, you should send email to 
<a href="mailto:cs314@cs.cornell.edu">cs314@cs.cornell.edu</a> or talk to one of the consultants. </p>
